* -i set messurment intervall in s, use -i? to get current intervall
* -t run self test
* -ct set current ambient Temperature(Â°C), used for Offset Calibration

* Command Line Tool: `cc PC/biosphere.c -o PC/biosphere; ./PC/biosphere /dev/ttyUSB0 -r`
* Microcontroller: `make program -C ./Microcontroller`
